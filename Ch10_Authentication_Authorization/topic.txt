authorization and authentication


Authentication: This is the process of verifying the identity 
        of a user or system. It's like checking someone's ID 
        to make sure they are who they claim to be. For example, 
        when you log in to a website using your username and 
        password, you are being authenticated.

Authorization: This is the process of determining what an 
        authenticated user or system is allowed to do. It's 
        like checking if someone has the right permissions to 
        access a certain area or perform a specific action. 
        For example, after logging in, the system checks if 
        you have the right permissions to access certain 
        features or data.
